2. Introduction 
Purpose:The purpose of this roadmap is to guide the development of a basic 
Ecommerce Product Listing Website. The roadmap outlines the key steps involved 
in creating a responsive and user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse 
products by category, view prices, filter results, and access product details. It also 
serves as a learning project for mastering core web development concepts such as 
HTML/CSS layout design, dynamic JavaScript functionality, and UI 
responsiveness. 
Scope:This roadmap covers the development of the frontend of an Ecommerce 
website, including 
● Homepage with category listing 
● Product grid page with filter functionality 
● Optional product detail view 
● Responsive layout for various screen sizes 
● Static product data stored in JavaScript 
● Backend implementation (e.g., user authentication, cart persistence, payment 
gateway) 
● Database integration 
● Advanced features like reviews, search autocomplete, or admin panels 
Importance:This roadmap is significant as it aligns with the learning objectives of 
foundational web development and UI/UX principles. From an educational 
perspective, it strengthens skills in structuring projects, writing modular code, and 
creating clean, responsive designs. For organizations or learners aiming to build 
scalable ecommerce systems, this roadmap serves as the first building block toward 
a full-stack Ecommerce platform. 
3. Project Structure: The project files are organized in a modular structure for 
clarity and maintainability 
 
 
 
 
4. Technical Stack: 
● Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS) 
● Design: Responsive design using media queries 
● Version Control: Git and GitHub 
● Deployment Platform: GitHub 
5. Features and Functionalities 
● Product Categories: Homepage lists available categories like electronics, 
clothing, and accessories. 
● Product Listing: On selecting a category, a grid of products is displayed with 
name, image, and price. 
● Filtering Feature: Users can filter products dynamically based on price ranges. 
● Product Detail Page (Optional): Clicking on a product opens a detailed view with 
description and full image. 
● Responsive UI: The layout adapts gracefully to all screen sizes from desktop to 
mobile. 
● User Interface: Clean and consistent styling with emphasis on readability and 
usability.

8. Challenges Faced 
● Ensuring mobile responsiveness without using frameworks like Bootstrap. 
● Writing dynamic filtering logic purely in Vanilla JavaScript. 
● Organizing the UI to ensure consistency across different screen sizes. 
Solutions: 
Used custom media queries, modular JS functions, and thorough browser testing. Images 
were optimized for faster loading using reduced resolution formats and compression. 
9. Conclusion 
This project successfully demonstrates the fundamental components of an ecommerce 
frontend. It highlights skills in HTML structuring, CSS styling, JavaScript interactivity, 
and responsive design. The project lays a foundation for integrating backend support in 
the future for cart management, authentication, and payment features. The learning 
outcome includes better understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and 
user-centric UI design.
